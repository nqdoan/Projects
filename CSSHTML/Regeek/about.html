            <h1> Who are we?</h1>
                <p> Regeek is comprised of a small group of friends and family based in the North Houston/Cypress area. Founder Nguyen Doan is in his last 
                    semester as a student at the University of Houston studying Computer Science with a focus on Software Design. He works with computer 
                    hardware as a hobby and has a passion for helping others. Cousin to Nguyen Doan, is Vinh Pham, an expert in computer hardware, and a 
                    sophomore at the University of Houston with a goal to study Electrical Engineering Technology.</p>
            <h2> Our Goal</h2>
                <p> Regeek's goal is to help everyone have access to techology. We believe that every person/family should be able to afford a computer
                    and that working computer parts should not go to waste. We take donations from people who no longer use or want their parts, and try construct
                    computers that can be resold at cheap prices or given away for free. We also take dead parts responsibly recycle what can't be used 
                    and try to repair as much as we can for reuse. </p>
